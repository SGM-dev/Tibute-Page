            "Creating the web was really an act of desperation, because the
            situation without it was very difficult when I was working at CERN
            later. Most of the technology involved in the web, like the
            hypertext, like the Internet, multi-font text objects, had all been
            designed already. I just had to put them together. It was a step of
            generalizing, going to a higher level of abstraction, thinking about
            all the documentation systems out there as being possibly part of a
            larger imaginary documentation system."
